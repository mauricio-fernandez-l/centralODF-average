## Description

Demonstration files for 

**"On the orientation average based on central orientation density functions for polycrystalline materials"**

by Mauricio Fernández (publication in Journal of Elasticity https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10659-019-09754-8). The present Python 3 project is organized in three modules in the folder 'source'

* TensorCalculusNumpy.py
* TensorCalculusSympy.py
* CentralODFAverage.py

The present files help the user to reproduce all results and examples discussed in the aboved referred work. The user only needs to run the file

* main.py 

which calls the routines in 'source' and loads the data of the .txt-files saved in 'source/data'.
