## Description

Demonstration files for 

**[1] "On the orientation average based on central orientation density functions for polycrystalline materials"**

by Mauricio Fernández (publication in Journal of Elasticity https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10659-019-09754-8). 

## Source code

The Python 3 source code is organized in three modules in the folder 'src'

* TensorCalculusNumpy.py
* TensorCalculusSympy.py
* CentralODFAverage.py

## Demonstration notebooks

The first two demonstration notebooks show how permutation basis for isotropic tensor spaces can be generated and how the isotropic D tensors in [1] may be computed.

* [01 Generation of a permutation basis](.01_permutation_basis.ipynb)
* [02 D tensors](.02_D_tensors.ipynb)

The remaining three demonstration notebooks correspond to the examples discussed in [1] in section 3.

* [03 Materials design](.03_materials_design.ipynb): see pubished work [1], section 3.1
* [04 Higher order elasticity](.04_higher_order_elasticity.ipynb): see pubished work [1], section 3.2
* [05 Texture](.03_materials_design.ipynb): see pubished work [1], section 3.3
